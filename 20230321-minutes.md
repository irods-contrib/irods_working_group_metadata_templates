## Minutes

Update/Discussion:

 - Goal: Draft paper for circulation among group
 - RDA20 - Sweden - attended a couple sessions on maDMP
   - They are struggling to get to consensus as well on what should be included
   - Every discipline has its own language/details
   - Consistency is really hard / impossible
 - KU Leuven
   - Rewrote a schema editor in vanilla javascript - DEMO
     - Part of ManGO (PRC-based portal)
   - Draft/published/versioning included -> results in a JSON file
     - Just single version can be published at a time
     - Publishing a new version makes attached items 'invalid'
       - No sweeping/detection yet, that's later
       - Tough to do generically - probably have to be domain-specific
     - Deleting an item from the template
       - Next time a data object or collection's metadata is updated/edited
       - The removed item will no longer be available to edit
       - Will be deleted from the data object or collection
     - Multiple templates attached to single item
       - They are namespaced, so they can be merged / do not conflict
     - Investigating whether to use versioning information in the 'unit' field
       - For both the template version and/or the metadata version
       - Could also save snapshots of existing data if the schemas change
   - Currently following a project paradigm: have permissions for a 3rd-level collection. for example /\<zone\>/homes/\<projectA\>
     - Anyone in the project can manage templates for that project
     - Could also have templates for each User, provided they have a home collection
     - Current storage manager is using file system
       - A native irods storage manager is on the todo list (and permissions can be more fine grained then as well)
   - Needs more documentation
     - Will publish/share the repository 'soon'
 - Next Meeting: 
   - Apr 2023
