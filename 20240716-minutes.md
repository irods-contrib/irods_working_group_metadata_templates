## Minutes

 - Converting/representing schema to JSON can be a pluggable interface
   - Default can do what we've got here today - just flat key/value (with stomping)
   - Plugin / override could define Leuven way of using schema / array information
   - Would be called before validate to prepare the JSON
     - https://github.com/irods-contrib/irods_working_group_metadata_templates/blob/44498830cf156198cd5d225c28e594a3bc2c9ad3/metadata_templates.py#L129C1-L133C1 
 - Next Steps
   - Plugin/override mechanism for JSON representation
   - Add schema attachment to data objects
   - Validate data object will take into consideration any schemas attached to that data object (requires gather for data object)
 - Leuven
   - Working to share schemas / public - across groups
   - Storing schema in JSON format with validation AND UI information
     - Want to separate these two from one another
       - JSON-Schema for validation
       - Validation currently happening in client side only (ManGO)
       - So other clients can still do whatever they want
 - GRAU
   - Looking for initial use case / install to learn more
 - Next Meeting
   - August 2024
