## Minutes

- Four 'microservices'
  - Attach and Detach - confirmed working, need error handling
  - Gather - WIP
    - Getting the URL content works
    - Return an array of schemas?  Array of one/zero is fine.
    - Caching? No, not yet, could be built/added later or by others
  - Validate
    - Looping through the array
      - Combine and run validation via AllOf
      - Validate each independently
        - jsonschema.validate(schema, data)
        - Collect any errors
          - Fail fast option...
            - don't loop through all the schemas?
    - Return OK or pile of errors
      - Could return a non-zero on an empty array?
      - Option?  Default would return error on empty array (this is safer)
- Lazlo - question
  - What about users and group and data objects and resources?
  - Seems like we would need a ... type of object?
  - OR separate function for each type
  - Not integrated, concerns are separated
  - Possible naming conventions
    - Metadata_templates_gather
    - Metadata_templates_collection_gather
    - Metadata_templates_resource_gather
    - Metadata_templates_resource_validate
    - Metadata_templates_gather_collection
      - Recursive - definitely
    - Metadata_templates_gather_group
      - Recursive - this doesn't make any sense
    - Metadata_templates_gather_user
      - Recursive? Meaning all its groups? Different name?
    - Metadata_templates_gather_resource
      - Entire hierarchy... recursive?
  - Groups in groups - yoda has it, iRODS does not
- Next Meeting
  - June 2024
