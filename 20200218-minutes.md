## Minutes

GOAL: Build freestanding Metalnx -> MT API -> iRODS demo

TODO: Generate 3-4 CEDAR JSON schemas for holding/testing
 - https://cedar.metadatacenter.org/
 - Mike will generate a first representative epigenomics schema
 - Sequencing runs

TODO: Update the attribute in the AVU from $id to:
 - attribute: irods::metadata_template::schema
 - value: https://api.myjson.com/bins/17vejk
 - units: root
 - Similar to protections provided by https://github.com/irods/irods_rule_engine_plugin_metadata_guard/
 - https://github.com/MaastrichtUniversity/irods_avu_json-ruleset/blob/master/rules/core.py

TODO: Generate first draft of Swagger MT-iRODS API
 - List overall available MT in the pool
 - List attached MTs on an object/collection
 - Attach/Apply MT to an object/collection as required/optional
 - Remove MT from an object/collection
 - Resolve instance of MT based on an object/collection JSON
 - Resolve json schema(s) that defines the metadata to be applied via template X to collection Y
 - POSSIBLE - Rasterize? Set of nested/attached schemas down into a single schema

DEMO: Daniel Theunissen of CEDAR template from a couple years ago, will work to find a shared space/organization for templates and swagger API docs

INTERESTED: Use CEDAR as editor, then an export to local/external service of defined schemas

CONSIDER: use API peps rather than lower-level database peps, this will allow control for both atomic and singular metadata edit attempts
