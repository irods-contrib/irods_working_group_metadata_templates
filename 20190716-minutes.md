## Minutes

- User Group Meeting recap - Metadata mentioned everywhere, but not many people know enough to help or approach with their own opinions.  'Disappointing' amount of interaction around templates specifically.  But understandable.

- Updates
  - JSON Schema can encompass JSON-LD specific implementations…
  - Primarily focused on JSON, and it's just a mapping, and should be compatible (with anything in semantic web community… later)

- Should generate a table with the five elements/parts above and progress from the different groups and projects.
  - Python rules to encapsulate functionality we are defining/need
    - Might already have some of these
    - Preventative microservices that help permissions
  - Swagger API to define interface from the server side - for all clients

- NEED - Create/Destroy a set of AVUs need some transactionality around multiple rows from the server side.
- USE CASE - incorporating SKOS vocabularies / external ontologies / dereferencing cleanly
- KEY POINT - encourage asynchronous validation / checking from the server side to prevent performance cliff
- FOCUS - on the rules and API

- DECISION - to plan out a hackday and get some interoperability between projects

- Docker container with swagger API that can talk with metalnx as proof of concept
