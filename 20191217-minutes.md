      - Including unicode via PR

      - https://github.com/irods/irods/issues/4484
      - https://github.com/korydraughn/irods/blob/parallel_transfer_engine.mmap.m/unit_tests/src/test_rc_atomic_apply_metadata_operations.cpp
  - Need to continue shaping the Swagger API, notes in Oct meeting
  - Goal: Build freestanding Metalnx -> MT API -> iRODS demo


Operations in Swagger API
 - List overall available MT in the pool
 - List attached MTs on an object/collection
 - Attach/Apply MT to an object/collection as required/optional
 - Remove MT from an object/collection
 - Resolve instance of MT based on an object/collection JSON
 - Resolve json schema(s) that defines the metadata to be applied via template X to collection Y
 - POSSIBLE - Rasterize? Set of nested/attached schemas down into a single schema


Current Yoda json schemas are reactJS module... local/managed by utrecht

TODO:
 - Generate 3-4 CEDAR JSON schemas for holding/testing
 - Generate first draft of Swagger MT-iRODS API

PROPOSAL:
 - Update the $id on concern from Ton to be something elseâ€¦ possibly:
     - attribute: irods::metadata_template::schema
     - value: https://api.myjson.com/bins/17vejk
     - units: root
