## Attendees:

## Minutes

 - Python microservices
   - Saved to repository
   - Four bats tests, add / remove / validate collection with two objects
   - Presented at UGM2024
 - Conversion from JSON to AVUs and back?
   - Should this be a consortium-provided set of functions?
   - If so... now we have to agree.
   - OR, plugin!
 - Arrays instead of stomping identical a/v combinations
   - https://github.com/irods-contrib/irods_working_group_metadata_templates/blob/main/metadata_templates.py#L132C29-L132C76 
   - Could always build an array, and then collapse?
 - Leuven using schema name IN the Attribute to know which schema is in play
   - Can determine whether to build an array or just single element
   - Requires 'naming' the schemas, and managing that namespace (and versioning)
 - Converting/representing schema to JSON can be a pluggable interface
   - Default can do what we've got here today
   - Plugin / override could define Leuven way of using schema / array information
   - Would be called before validate to prepare the JSON
     - https://github.com/irods-contrib/irods_working_group_metadata_templates/blob/44498830cf156198cd5d225c28e594a3bc2c9ad3/metadata_templates.py#L129C1-L133C1 
 - Only attaching schemas to collections today
   - Now, for â€¦ users / groups / resources / data objects?
   - Data object validate would validate against schema on data object AND all parents (if recursive)
   - Allows for 'reuse' because schemas are not in iRODS, references to external
 - Versioning
   - Different schema versions cannot be in play at the same time with current design
   - Leuven allows for multiple versions in flight at the same time because each data object declares which schemas 
   - Yoda, on update of a schema, walks the affected data objects / collections to 'convert' to the new version, if a transformation is available.
     - And one should be available, or an 'error' by the admin.
   - JSON-Schema does not have an inherent notion of versioning
     - Depends on the schema just having a different name that 'means' a different version
   - This might not be the consortium's job
     - To be handled 'up there', per namespace / application
 - Leuven does not 'attach' to the collections themselves
   - Instead, things are more 'composed'
   - The metadata is declaring which schema it's a part of
   - Mango-specific, until now a Python module presented at UGM2024
   - Handles versioning
   - Weakness / loophole for now is how to indicate metadata applying to parent / grandparent applies to children / data objects
 - Yoda attaches schema to a user group
   - Singular(!) collection managed/associated to that group
     - But also groups in groups!
   - Data objects under that collection are 'validated' against that schema
   - Leuven using 'realms' like group, schemas 'owned' by a realm today
     - Want to share across realms, potentially soon
 - Next Steps
   - Plugin/override mechanism for JSON representation
   - Add schema attachment to data objects
   - Validate data object will take into consideration any schemas attached to that data object (requires gather for data object)
 - Next Meeting
   - July 2024
