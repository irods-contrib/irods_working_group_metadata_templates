- Discussion
    - metalnx currently stores template information in the AVUs directly
    - aim for first of july for metalnx v2.0.0
    - irods-ext database as repository for sidecar
    - swagger spec allows application of templates at any level (many-to-many)
    - current work is
        - define a template (json)   public/private
        - made of elements, validation, possible grouping
        - so users don't see bag of AVUs - guidance
        - users see forms, not just empty boxes
        - using external SKOS metadata services, controlled vocabularies
    - maastricht has integrated with Disqover, we want a clean look too
        - compared notes at UGM2018
    - formbot is in the development branch of jargon-extensions repository
        - https://github.com/DICE-UNC/jargon-extensions/tree/development/metadata-templates/src/main/java/org/irods/jargon
    - some composability being requested from industry
        - definition coming from 'above'/administrator
        - application-specific capability to merge/add context to admin-defined templates
    - dataverse, cyverse already have ideas too
    - think about capabilities (aka search)
        - what should be grouped when pulled back to the interface
        - in the end, need to be displayed to a human
    - use cases
        - virtual collections could be defined by a set of search attributes informed by metadata template
        - publication
        - validation
    - need to remember to be concerned about scalability
        - exif everywhere, metadata catalog getting large
        - need to separate to other tables/services
        - also ability to limit extra metadata, to minimize cruft
    - QueryArrowâ€¦ approach is to layer it atop indexing framework (atop 4.2+)
        - do testing for scalability and speed
    - required interfaces for javascript and python
    - iRODS rest services (Swagger definition)  https://github.com/irods-contrib/irods_rest_services
    - code to the interface
        - swagger api (provide a service) in front of the json documents
        - insulate the implementation of saving json files in iRODS
        - metalnx will be the first implementation

- ACTION - new repo for this working group in irods-contrib namespace
    - will link back to existing work

- metalnx v2.0.0 progress (aiming for july 1)
    - rules across a zone
    - tickets mostly work
    - rnd working, can be packaged separately
    - microservices mostly working
    - placeholder that says 'NO ACCESS', and possibly request access
