## Minutes

Update/Discussion:

  - BMS using Gen3, has a query interface, looking for more
    - GUID issue conflicting with iRODS ids
    - Meeting with CyVerse/NIEHS/RENCI/BMS this afternoon 2p
  - Ton - GoFAIR - interesting/unexpected approach to templates
    - Templating like Jinja templating
    - More layout, rather than data model/structure
    - Christine Kilpatrick, possible GoFAIR contact UCSD
  - Assessment - perhaps we cannot / will not find the 'one ring'
    - Can we work with the raw materials a bit more directly
    - May have to abstract again, let deployment pick their flavor
      - But may not be able to 'cross the streams' from different applications
  - Similar to policy composition approach
    - Abstract for generic, keep the policy on the server
    - Let a deployment make their own decisions / definitions
    - Front end picks its template representations
    - Back end supports whatever is selected


  - GUI asks for template on collection
    - Server policy returns the requested bundle of data
    - GUI renders it

  - Client defines the schema they have/want
    - Server receives the request, generates that resulting schema

  - Andrey - beneficial to have one AVU to many different objects (at the same time) that would be updated if the template gets updated
    - Cascading updates are expensive / complicated
    - Atomicity - per template?  Per operation?  Resolve the universe, then commit?
    - Possible new type of metadata, that is defined in one place, applied in many

New reassessed focus...
  - No longer need to define standard template language/schema
  - Instead, just use what the client is using
  - Still need to consider hierarchical / references in schemas

TODO: Generate first draft of Swagger MT-iRODS API

  - List overall available MT in the pool
  - Add external MT into 'pool'
  - List attached MTs on an object/collection
  - Attach/Apply MT to an object/collection as required/optional
  - Remove MT from an object/collection
  - Resolve instance of MT based on an object/collection JSON
  - Resolve json schema(s) that defines the metadata to be applied via template X to collection Y
  - BONUS - Rasterize / Pre-assemble? Set of nested/attached schemas down into a single schema
