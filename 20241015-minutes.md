## Minutes

 - Server-side functions have been merged
 - Usage from the community
   - Utrecht interested in using this functionality in Yoda 2.0
     - Currently managing 3 templates themselves
       - Want to expand that, be smaller / composable
       - Researchers are asking for their own, sometimes
   - Leuven still working to convert method of describing their AVUs/JSON
     - Where and how to manage those standards
     - This working group creates a good starting point for them
 - Future work
   - This code will be incorporated into Python Rule Engine Plugin and shipped with a next release.  Perhaps in 4.3.x or 5.0â€¦
   - It's available without any other dependencies, so doesn't require that it be 'shipped' to be useful / tested.
 - Next Meeting?
   - Not before January 2025
   - But we think we're done?
   - Eight years of work
