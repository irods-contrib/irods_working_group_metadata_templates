## Attendees:

Terrell Russell, Kory Draughn, Daniel Moore, Ton Smeele, Ilari Korhonen, Dave Fellinger, Deep Patel

## Minutes

- Ton input for meeting: 
  - Wish to have the `AVU_batch_operation` be applied to arbitrary type of iRODS entity (data object, collection, resource, user).
  - _json_input structure is sufficient to only operate on 1 object, not allow multiple objects (to avoid locking too many icat records).   The set of operations must be executed as a single db transaction  (atomic).  
    Note that _rs calls typically only work on 1 object at a time.   There should be no need to sync replicas after the operations have executed (?) as the AVU operations will only affect the logical object level. 

- "_json_input" must have the following structure:
```
 * {
 *  entity_name: “object name”,
 *  entity_type : “object type”,     (any of ‘d’ ‘C’ ‘R’ ‘u’ according to semantics imeta) 
 *   [
 *      {
 *        "operation": "set or remove",
 *        "attribute": "a0",
 *        "value": "v0",
 *        "units": "u0"
 *      },
 *     ...
 *   ]
 * }
 * "units" are optional.
```

Gather this code in one place / build it…

Automated functional test from end-to-end

Database side more important… still need to do the work as an atomic transaction.

Eventually a Swagger API definition of the Metadata Templates endpoints

Atomic is more important than batch… batch arguably not helpful without being atomic.

Atomic would need to be on a particular object/user/item

Demo uses `irods::filesystem`, so only handled collections and data objects at this time

New atomic issue captured in irods/irods
