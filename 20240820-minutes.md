## Minutes

 - Converting/representing schema to JSON can be a pluggable interface
   - Implemented, testing now
   - Works by assuming a module in /etc/irods (initial testing leuven.py)
   - Bench testing done, existing bats tests still pass
 - Also, preliminary schema attachment to data objects
   - Validate data object will take into consideration any schemas attached to that data object (requires gather for data object)
 - At the moment, avu_function limited (design feature) to single dotted name
   - What happens if someone passes in leuven.coolthing.myfunction?
     - TBD, maybe not necessary at this time
 - Schemas currently required to be 'public' and visible because of 'url' pointer
   - Could discuss where else they might need to live, if secret
   - Could also be 'local' absolute path, with correct permissions
   - Could also be 'in iRODS' with full logical path
 - Next Meeting
   - September 2024
