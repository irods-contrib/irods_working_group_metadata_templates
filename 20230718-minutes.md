## Minutes

Update/Discussion:

 - Goal: Draft paper for circulation among group
   - 6 years of what we've learned
   - Need to add Namespacing/Leuven to paper
 - Goal: develop/release microservices for attach/detach and validation
   - Can define these before next meeting - see if we can agree on naming, parameters/signatures
   - Perhaps also an export/collapse/rasterize msi
   - Reference counter / SQL to know if a schema is 'used'
 - Possible future - MT gets its own iRODS database table, first class object
   - GenQuery
   - Permissions
   - API for management
   - Reference external schema?  Keep the text IN iRODS itself?
   - A much bigger amount of effort, probably not in the near term
 - Leuven - need to validate schemas against JSON-Schema eventually
   - Currently schema is used to present the form, rather than validate the data
   - Possibly separate / combine / complement two schemas?
     - A wrapper for the form/display information?
     - Data types are a bit richer than vanilla JSON-Schema at the moment
   - Active phase doesn't 'require' all the metadata, but then on export/repository, all the required metadata must be present
     - Allow the tool/display to aid/assist the user to 'build' / 'pull' existing metadata from others into this 'new' data association
     - Then there is less work during the 'export' step, as most of the earlier metadata is already valid/good.
   - JSON-Schema also would be useful for export of metadata itself
     - Want to compare/validate against a foreign reference / schema
     - Possible mapping to other names, but same ideas
   - Inheritance from 'above', where does this get defined?  What happens when it updates 'up there'?  Is it recursive 'all the way down'?
     - Maybe only on 'export'.  Checkbox per metadata item?
     - Since it is only 'applied' to the parent, not ALL the children
       - Otherwise, too much duplicate data in the database
     - When exported.. Does it include the reference to the parent schema?  Or just get combined/included/collapsed to the exported data.  Just flat on export.
     - Reference counter to prevent deletion/loss of connected/referenced schemas upon 'removal' - this is hard.  Perhaps should be in the app layer... or perhaps the schema machinery in the server should do this natively.  Probably best to 'just be SQL', rather than a cached/outofdate/counter.  Learned this lesson with the object_count and rmresc.
   - Composite objects - should these be individual AVUs, or a unit of multipleâ€¦ multiple isn't as searchable
     - Used AVU unit as the glue/composite information
 - IT4I - currently forcing users to only use a single schema, simple for now
   - exporting/syncing with elasticsearch for external apps/search, from multiple zones
 - Next Meeting
   - Aug 2023

 - After meeting (Terrell with Kory)...
   - Paper
     - 6y (yes, no, scope, examples)
     - namespacing
     - inheritance
     - msi (3-4) (just AVUs)
   - Later
     - New MT table(s)
       - Template definitions
       - Join table for associations with data_id/coll_id
   - Microservices
     - Attach (type, schema, object_id)
       - Initially, type will just be 'url'
       - Could later be 'irods_schema' and store the id from the new table
       - Or 'form' for ManGO wrapper/form information
     - Detach (type, schema, object_id)
     - Validate (object_id, recursive)
       - Run gather (below) to build the effective json schema
       - Get and build json payload with all current AVUs
       - Run payload and schema through validator
       - Return result (OK or failure/explanation)
     - Export/Collapse/Rasterize/Gather/Dump (object_id, recursive)
       - Find all associated schemas and construct effective schema
       - Recursive would check/gather all parents up to root
   - JSON Schema Only
     - Could have ManGO form information in a different schema 'type'
       - Could reference 'real' JSON Schema with anchors/names
       - Apps would compose when needed (to draw a form)
     - Gather/Validate would ignore the form schemas
