## Minutes

Update/Discussion:
 - Show progress on four python 'microservices'
   - Attach and Detach - initial work done, need error checking
   - Gather -  next
   - Validate - last, depends on Gather
   - A collection can have more than one AVU / attached template?
     - Certainly hope so / think so
     - This is the design at the moment
   - Can we return an arbitrarily long string (gathered schemas) to a client/irule?
     - We think so.   A packstruct limitation?  We think not.
     - 'just a buffer', should appear in stdout?
     - Just msParamArray, should be unbounded
 - Next Meeting
   - Feb 2023
