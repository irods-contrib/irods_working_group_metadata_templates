10:00 am EDT

## Attendees:

Terrell Russell, Kory Draughn, Alan King, Paul van Schayck, Daniel Theunissen, Deep Patel, Mike Conway

## Minutes

- Status

  - Have consolidated previous minutes/diagrams into github repository
  - Atomic function for setting a batch of AVUs
      - Still investigating direct database interactions (BEGIN/COMMIT)
      - https://github.com/irods/irods/issues/4484

Python rules
 - REST API endpoints to call the python rules

Reconsider the PEPs available for the AVUs...
 - One PEP per AVU, rather than ... sometimes, 'set' could touch multiple AVUs, but only one firing of the function
 - Could possibly address a limitation that we cannot see all the AVUs touched ... could accidentally update other things, possibly violating some MT validation...
 - Could also inform when to update the indexes/elasticsearch that might depend on updates to AVUs...
 - Also note that the wildcard operations are extremely tricky to instrument correctly

Operations in Swagger API
 - Resolve MTs based on an object/collection
 - List attached MTs on an object/collection
 - Attach/Apply MT to an object/collection as required/optional
 - Remove MT from an object/collection
 - List overall available MT in the pool
 - Resolve json schema(s) that defines the metadata to be applied via template X to collection Y
 - POSSIBLE - Rasterize? Set of nested/attached schemas down into a single schema

Should look into consolidating
 - https://github.com/MaastrichtUniversity/irods_avu_json
 - https://github.com/MaastrichtUniversity/irods_avu_json-ruleset
 - https://github.com/MaastrichtUniversity/irods_avu_json-docker

Paul will PR into https://github.com/irods-contrib/irods_working_group_metadata_templates
 - Initial consolidation for 4.2.6
 - Then incorporate changes for upcoming 4.2.7 (using new built-in msiModAVUMetadata)

Then we'll construct new swagger API in this namespace as well
