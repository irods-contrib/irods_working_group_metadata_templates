## Minutes

Update/Discussion:
  - Subject areas should drive this work
  - Server can only react to specific requests
  - Consider recasting this group to be 'Metadata' rather than about Templates
  - iRODS can't/shouldn't be defining the templates for anyone?
    - Site-specific knowledge and interfaces are too diverse
  - PEPs / microservices / functions to validate, but not manage the templates themselves
  - Template management is too big a task for the server/policy
  - Metadata for search is very different than metadata for validation/orchestration/policy
  - Optimizations for retrieving metadata for orchestration and/or policy 
  - Investigate unused description column in the AVU table
    - Instructions for the human creation
    - Possible type system on AVU
    - Behavioural types for AVUS
    - Permissions, to allow non-owners to annotate / use AVUs
  - Consider breaking apart the functionality of what a template does
    - Annotation
    - Validation
    - External references
    - Define parent/child relationships between metadata elements
      - Recursive query syntax of SQL
  - These parts together could be stitched together on a per site/application
    - Provide 70-80% of the original intent of metadata templates
  - Goal: iRODS metadata to become a first class citizen
    - Indexing and templates and policy are downstream from the 'truth'
  - Next meeting:
    - Work on a whitepaper / lessons learned / goals
    - August 2021
