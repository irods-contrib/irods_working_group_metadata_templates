## Minutes

Update/Discussion:

   - Jargon learning atomic metadata api
      - Awaiting Mike Conway - then can work on NFSRODS and use this endpoint to create this Metadata Template implementation
      - Awaiting a bit more experience with the atomic metadata API in the wild
   - Next steps are to develop server-side rule implementations for bind/resolve/merge as part of Swagger API
   - Project level metadata is useful, and not beyond human scale at first
   - Need some more use cases / stakeholders / examples
   - Schemas for metadata still themselves are being formed/agreed to
