Status:

MERGED 4/15: Atomic Metadata Operations API https://github.com/irods/irods/pull/4808

GOAL: Build freestanding Metalnx -> MT API -> iRODS demo

TODO: Generate 3-4 CEDAR JSON schemas for holding/testing
 - https://cedar.metadatacenter.org/
 - Mike has generated a first representative schema - EpigenomicsRun
   - Sequencing runs
   - https://openview.metadatacenter.org/templates/https:%2F%2Frepo.metadatacenter.org%2Ftemplates%2Fbd213a63-a175-4604-a2e4-085ad9ef5923 
   - TODO: how do we see this information/json schema without having a CEDAR login?

TODO: Update the attribute in the AVU from $id to:
 - attribute: irods::metadata_template::schema
 - value: https://api.myjson.com/bins/17vejk
 - units: root
 - Similar to protections provided by https://github.com/irods/irods_rule_engine_plugin_metadata_guard/
 - https://github.com/MaastrichtUniversity/irods_avu_json-ruleset/blob/master/rules/core.py

IN PROGRESS: First draft of Swagger MT-iRODS API
 - https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/irods/metadata_templates/0.1#/info
 - Should use local cached copies of metadata schemas, with local IDs
 - These IDs get used/passed around, URL only stored in local representation once
 - Should have CRUD on these local cached copies
 - All template/schemas in the world by URL - available to be added to this system
 - Local system - caches/references to external URLs, that get a local ID
 - NOTE - reproduce all use cases
 - GET template
   - List overall available MT in the local system (pool)
 - PUT template
   - Add a new template to the system
 - POST template
   - List attached MTs on an object/collection
 - POST template/add
   - Attach/Apply MT to an object/collection as required/optional
 - POST template/remove
   - Remove MT from an object/collection
 - POST template/resolve
   - Resolve instance of MT based on an object/collection JSON
 - POST schema/resolve
   - Resolve json schema(s) that defines the metadata to be applied via template X to collection Y
 - POST schema/rasterize
   - Rasterize set of nested/attached schemas down into a single schema

CONSIDER: trigger on iRODS API PEPs rather than lower-level database PEPs
 - this will allow control/policy for both atomic and singular metadata edit attempts

DISCUSSION: microservices *should maybe* grow PEPs as well?  Mostly concerned with authorization issues.  Could be mitigated for now with the microservices calling server_api_call, thereby going back through the PEP machinery in the server.

DISCUSSION: additional requirement may include instances of JSON to be able to refer to their controlled vocabulary that defines the elements - use of 'rel/describedby' and 'href' within each property.  CEDAR doesn't currently support this, but may as the standards come into focus.
 - { "$id": "http://example.com/myschema.json", "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/schema#", "type": "object", "additionalProperties": false, "properties": { "links": { "type": "array", "minItems": 1, "maxItems": 1, "items": { "type": "object", "additionalProperties": false, "required": [ "rel", "href" ], "properties": { "rel": { "const": "describedby" }, "href": { "const": "http://example.com/myschema.json" } }}}, "title": { "type": "string" }, "parameters": { "type": "object", "additionalProperties": false, "properties": { "size": { "type": "number" }, "readOnly": { "type": "boolean" } }}, "authors": { "type": "array", "items": { "type": "string" } }, "references": { "type": "array", "items": { "type": "object", "additionalProperties": false, "properties": { "title": { "type": "string" }, "doi": { "type": "string" } }}}}} 
 - { "links": [ { "rel": "describedby", "href": "http://example.com/myschema.json", } ], "title": "Hello World!", "parameters": { "size": 42, "readOnly": false }, "authors": [ "Foo", "Bar" ], "references": [ { "title": "The Rule Engine", "doi": "1234.5678" } ] } 
 - JSON Schema specifies that a metadata template reference can optionally be included in a JSON structure as a  Linked Description Object (LDO) 5 through the linked data protocol using a ”describedby” relationship [7]. For the  purpose of validation, we will require the LDO to be included in each namespace. As a result, when the JSON  structure is converted to corresponding AVUs, the resulting set will always include AVU information with the LDO  that provides a reference to the ruling metadata template for this namespace. This method ensures that the ruling  metadata template for a namespace is registered with the iRODS object
