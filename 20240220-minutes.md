## Metadata Templates Working Group Minutes

Tuesday, 2024/02/20

10:00 am ET

## Attendees:

Terrell Russell, Alan King, Mike Conway (NIEHS), Lazlo Westerhof (Utrecht)

## Minutes

Update/Discussion:
 - Four 'microservices'
   - Attach and Detach - need error handling
   - Gather and Validate
 - Collection with more than one template
   - What happens when there is a collision/stomping of naming (e.g. title)?
   - At the same level (not recursive / on the parent)
 - Limit on returned gathered/aggregated size?
   - Lazlo - thinks yes, somewhere... looking...
     - Size limit was keeping the template in the database itself
     - We're avoiding that by only pointing to templates stored elsewhere
 - Next Meeting
   - Mar 2024
