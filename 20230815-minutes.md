## Attendees:

Terrell Russell, Kory Draughn, Alan King, Jessica Natonick, Lazlo Westerhof (Utrecht)

## Minutes

Update/Discussion:

 - Utrecht has already done this separation
   - UI Schema - React valid JSON-Schema form information
   - Metadata Schema - valid JSON-Schema
   - Research space - no metadata required, but can fill it in
     - Same schemas, just ignore the 'required' errors
     - Implemented in python, using the validators
   - Vault space - has to be requirements, export/publication mandates
     - Enforces the full schemas
 - Microservices (as plugins, not irods/irods at the beginning)
   - UU has a python ruleset
     - When metadata file is updated, rules fire to push/pull into the iRODS AVUs and back to JSON file
     - Schemas live in iRODS themselves, but are referenced by collection_name (which holds both schema files - by contract/assumption)
   - Do these AVUs need to be protected by metadata_guard?
     - A: irods::metadata_templates
     - V: http://coolthinghere
     - U: data [data/ui]
     - These are on a collection?  And/Or a data_object directly? Not at UU.
     - UU has no recursive references yet, still flat
     - Jonathan Melius also probably interested
   - Attach (type, schema, object_id)
     - Initially, type will just be 'url'
     - Could later be 'irods_schema' and store the id from the new table
     - Or 'form' for ManGO wrapper/form information
   - Detach (type, schema, object_id)
   - Validate (object_id, recursive)
     - Run gather (below) to build the effective json schema
     - Get and build json payload with all current AVUs
     - Run payload and schema through validator
     - Return result (OK or failure/explanation)
   - Export/Collapse/Rasterize/Gather/Dump (object_id, recursive)
     - Find all associated schemas and construct 'effective' schema
     - Recursive would check/gather all parents up to root
 - Next Meeting
   - Sept 2023
