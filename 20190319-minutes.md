## Minutes

Updates...

- Mike working on https://github.com/irods-contrib/metalnx-web/issues/97
- Metalnx template stored in the metalnx database, but now as JSON/JSON-Schema
  - Would remove the XML import/export format
  - Easier to use with Python rules and other tooling
  - Referenceable as URI
  - Should play well with CEDAR and other work being done in the Netherlands

- Add a metalnx button that marks a data-object ready to be validated/checked
  - Need to define the AVU itself
  - A: irods::metadata_template
  - V: timestamp?
  - U: GUID or template name

- Need to write a PEP or rule that will validate the data-object against the defined template

- Possibly use the comment field in the AVU table to store information/bookkeeping
  - But won't be visible via iRODS API (Older clients/servers couldn't participate)
